💻 My First Website Clone – HTML & CSS Only
Hey there! 👋
This is a simple website clone I built using just HTML and CSS. I wanted to test my skills and see how well I could recreate a real web page layout from scratch — and I finally did it! 😄

🎥 Demo
Check out the quick preview of the project here:
📽️ Final Video.mp4 [from my github same repo]
<video width="100%" controls>
  <source src="https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name/blob/main/demo.mp4?raw=true" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

🛠️ Tech Used
HTML5
CSS3
No frameworks, no libraries — just pure, raw frontend basics 💪

🔍 What I Practiced
Writing clean and structured HTML
Styling with CSS — layouts, colors, fonts, spacing
Using Flexbox to position elements
Paying attention to real design details and improving visual accuracy

🧠 Lessons I Learned
This wasn’t just about copying how a site looks — it taught me:
How much goes into layout structuring
Why spacing and alignment are everything
That patience + zooming in = pixel perfection 😅

🔄 What’s Next?
Make it mobile-friendly (responsive)
Add simple animations or transitions
Try building a JavaScript version next
